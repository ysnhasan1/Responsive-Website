# Responsive-Website
Creating a Responsive Website with Flexbox and Media Queries.

In this project, I wanted to show that flexbox is a great option for building responsive website.
With flexbox, which has a very simple structure, we can create websites and make them responsive to different screen sizes.
We can also use media queries with flexbox.

You can see some screenshots and gifs of the website I created.
